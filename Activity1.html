    <p class="center verse">
        <span class="verse-label">[Verse 1]</span> <br>
        Risin' up, back on the street <br>
        Did my time, took my chances <br>
        Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet<br>
        Just a man and his will to survive<br>
        So many times it happens too fast<br>
        You trade your passion for glory<br>
        Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past<br>
        You must fight just to keep them alive
    </p>

    <p class="center">
        [Chorus]<br>
        It's the eye of the <span class="tiger">tiger</span> it's the thrill of the fight<br>
        Risin' up to the challenge of our rival<br>
        And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night<br>
        And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
    </p>

    <p class="center verse">
        <span class="verse-label">[Verse 2]</span><br>
        Face to face, out in the heat<br>
        Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry<br>
        They stack the odds till we take to the street<br>
        For the kill with the skill to survive
    </p>

    <p class="center">
        [Chorus]<br>
        It's the <span class="tiger">eye of the tiger</span>, it's the thrill of the fight<br>
        Risin' up to the challenge of our rival<br>
        And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night<br>
        And he's watching us all with the eye of the <span class="tiger">tiger</span>

    <p class="center verse">
        <span class="verse-label">[Verse 3]</span><br>
        Risin' up, straight to the top<br>
        Had the guts, got the glory<br>
        Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop<br>
        Just a man and his will to survive
