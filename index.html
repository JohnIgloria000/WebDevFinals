                <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                <p >Hi, I’m John — a web development student driven by curiosity, creativity, and a strong commitment to building meaningful digital experiences. With a foundation in front-end and back-end development, I approach every project with an eye for both 
                    functionality and visual clarity, aiming to craft responsive, accessible, and user-centered websites.
                    This portfolio showcases my academic work, personal projects, and ongoing learning in full-stack web development. Each project reflects not just technical skills in HTML, CSS,  and JavaScript, but also the thought process, problem-solving, and storytelling that drive my growth as a developer.
                    Feel free to explore, review my work, or reach out for collaboration. I’m always open to new ideas, constructive feedback, and opportunities to grow alongside others in the tech community.
                    Thank you for stopping by.

                <h3>2011 - 2017</h3>
                <p>I began my academic journey in Pampanga, where I completed my primary education as a consistent honor student. These early years helped me build a 
                    strong foundation in reading, writing, and logical thinking—skills that would later support my interest in coding and web development. More than 
                    academic recognition, I value the patience, perseverance, and curiosity I developed during this time, which continue to shape my approach to learning 
                    new technologies and solving problems creatively.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="education-item">
                <h3>2017 - 2023</h3>
                <p>I completed my high school education under the K–12 curriculum, where I began to develop a strong interest in technology and digital design. 
                    During this time, I was introduced to basic programming concepts and digital tools that sparked my curiosity in web development. While balancing
                    academic responsibilities, I also explored creative problem-solving through group projects and school activities. These formative years helped
                    me build the discipline, attention to detail, and growth mindset that continue to guide me as I pursue further studies in web development.</p>

                <h3>2023 - Present</h3>
                <p>I am currently pursuing my degree in web development and am entering my third year of study. My college journey has been both challenging and rewarding,
                     allowing me to deepen my knowledge in front-end and back-end technologies, user interface design, and responsive web practices. Through hands-on projects 
                     and collaborative learning, I’ve been able to apply theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios. As I continue my studies, I remain committed to improving
                      my technical skills, staying updated with industry trends, and growing as a responsible and adaptive developer.</p>
